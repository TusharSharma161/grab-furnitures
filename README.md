# SPA created by Tushar Sharma without using any frontend framework like Angular, React, etc
> Single Page Application built with Node.js and no dependencies

## About

This app works with HTML, CSS and plain JS.

There are no dependencies except bootstrap for styling.

## Usage
> How to run locally

Clone this repo or your fork of it.

Open the browser at your localhost URL _without_ a subpath. e.g.

- https://localhost:5500

Or, can install Live srever extension for VS Code and use the Go Live button displayed at the bottom right corner then.

## Notes

### Project name

I named the project _GrabFurnitures_ in keeping with the vanilla JS approach of the original project.

### Limitations

There are some limitations. Like refreshing a page or inputing a valid path manually in the address bar will give a error result. So maybe sure to start off from the root page each time and you make a change to the app locally.
