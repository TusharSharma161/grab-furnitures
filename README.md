# SPA created by Tushar Sharma without using any frontend framework like Angular, React, etc
> Single Page Application built with Node.js and no dependencies

## About

This app works with HTML, CSS and plain JS.

There are no dependencies except bootstrap for styling.

## Usage
> How to run locally

Clone this repo or your fork of it.

Open the browser at your localhost URL _without_ a subpath. e.g.

- https://localhost:5500

Or, can install Live srever extension for VS Code and use the Go Live button displayed at the bottom right corner then.

Or, You can also verify the live Application, which is made to load a wrong path (for products.json as ../../static/json/products.json) initially for better understanding of the error and loader functionalities.

> You can find it here : https://tusharsharma161.github.io/grab-furnitures

Although, I would recommend to setup it locally and then verify to get a better view of the application.

## Notes

### Project name

I named the project _GrabFurnitures_ in keeping with the vanilla JS approach of the original project.

### Limitations

There are some limitations. Like refreshing a page or inputing a valid path manually in the address bar will give a error result. So maybe sure to start off from the root page each time and you make a change to the app locally.
